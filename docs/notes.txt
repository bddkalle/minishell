Grammar:

    Expression:
    expr → factor { ( "&&" | "||" ) factor }
    (This means an expression is a factor optionally followed by one or more logical operators and additional factors.)

    Factor:
    factor → command | "(" expr ")"
    (A factor is either a command or a parenthesized expression.)
